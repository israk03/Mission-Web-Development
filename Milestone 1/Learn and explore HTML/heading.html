<p> In 1980 <small>In 1980</small>, physicist <strong> Tim Berners-Lee </strong>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for <i>CERN</i> researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>
